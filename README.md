# MicroProfile generated Application

## Introduction

MicroProfile Starter has generated this MicroProfile application for you.

The generation of the executable jar file can be performed by issuing the following command

    mvn clean package

This will create an executable jar file **liberty.jar** within the _target_ maven folder. This can be started by executing the following command

    java -jar target/liberty.jar


### Liberty Dev Mode

During development, you can use Liberty's development mode (dev mode) to code while observing and testing your changes on the fly.
With the dev mode, you can code along and watch the change reflected in the running server right away; 
unit and integration tests are run on pressing Enter in the command terminal; you can attach a debugger to the running server at any time to step through your code.

    mvn liberty:dev

To launch the test page, open your browser at the following URL

    http://localhost:9080/index.html

## Specification examples

By default, there is always the creation of a JAX-RS application class to define the path on which the JAX-RS endpoints are available.

Also, a simple Hello world endpoint is created, have a look at the class **HelloController**.

More information on MicroProfile can be found [here](https://microprofile.io/)

### Health

The health status can be used to determine if the 'computing node' needs to be discarded/restarted or not. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-health)

The class **ServiceHealthCheck** contains an example of a custom check which can be integrated to health status checks of the instance.  The index page contains a link to the status data.

### Rest Client

A type safe invocation of HTTP rest endpoints. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client)

The example calls one endpoint from another JAX-RS resource where generated Rest Client is injected as CDI bean.
